                                <h3>What is an Extraoral Camera?</h3>
                                <p>An extraoral camera is a type of imaging device used in dental practices to capture high-resolution images of the patient's oral and facial structures from outside the mouth. Unlike intraoral cameras, which are inserted into the oral cavity, extraoral cameras are positioned externally to take comprehensive views of the jaw, teeth, and surrounding areas.</p>
                                <p>Extraoral cameras can be integrated into various pieces of dental equipment, such as surgical lights and dental chairs, or used as standalone devices. They come in both wired and wireless options, offering different benefits depending on the practice's needs.</p>
